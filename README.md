# Important foreword

We learned enough about freezing python to binarys so from here on out it will be source code only.

We will not sent you any files or contact you about anything. You can see who contributed and everything regarding us will be only done on GitHub. We will not contact you in any matter or will send you files. There are scammers out there. Here you can read the full source code, compile it from scratch and such or download a VT-checked official release.

Attention: When ever this tool detects you are trying to manipulate a daily seeded run it will abort. We only do this for educating us and provide the source code opensource in compliance with PokeRogue's License.

- We take no responsibility for your actions when using this tool.  Whenever you startup tho a backup is created and stand: 03.07.2024 - they are applicable no matter created when.

- [Security Notice](TRANSPARENCY.md)

# FAQ

- How do i revert my changes?
  - The programm will always create backups everytime you login! When you load the first time it will create a `base_gameData(trainerID)_03.07.2024_18.03.22.json` unique based on your trainerID coupled with a timestamp. This applies for slot' data aswell; `backup_slotData(slotNumber_trainerID)_03.07.2024_18.03.22.json`. All subsequent backups will be prefixed with `backup_` and you can restore to any file back in time.

- Will this get me banned?
  - See [Regarding Bans and Limited Accounts](https://github.com/RogueEdit/onlineRogueEditor?tab=readme-ov-file#regarding-bans-and-limited-accounts)

- Where can i donate?
  - We will not accept any money or any form of payment. If you want to help then only by contributing. We do it for education only, any critique welcome.
